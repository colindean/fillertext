Introduction
------------

FillerText is a gem useful for generating, well, filler text. It can do the standard "lorem ipsum" text or a variety of other clever substitute texts.

Installing FillerText
---------------------

Install using:

```sh
gem install fillertext
```

or add the gem to your project's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'fillertext'
```

Using FillerText
----------------

Here's how you use FillerText.

There are two main ways. One is cleaner because it keeps FillerText within its
own namespace. The other method will add `Fixnum#filler` to keep some tasty
syntactical sugar.

```ruby
FillerText::FillerText.sentences 5
FillerText::FillerText.words 2
FillerText::FillerText.characters 5
FillerText::FillerText.bytes 4
FillerText::FillerText.paragraphs 1
```

or the *much* easier and intended method:

```ruby
2.filler.sentences
1.filler.paragraphs
```

You can also change the style from the default "lorem ipsum" to something else.

```ruby
# the old favorite
FillerText::FillerText.style = FillerText::Style::LoremIpsum
# a mash of words
FillerText::FillerText.style = FillerText::Style::HipsterIpsum
# handmade just like grandma's pierogies
FillerText::FillerText.style = FillerText::Style::YinzerIpsum
# homage to the great Pittsburgh Penguins announcer
FillerTest::FillerText.style = FillerText::Style::MikeLange
```

2.
	1. Run `rspec` to run all the tests by default
	2. To run only a selected few tests, run `rspec spec/<test_you're_interested_in>_spec.rb`
3. To access code coverage details, run `xdg-open coverage/index.html` (on Linux) or `open coverage/index.html` (on Mac)

Patches welcome. Please file using Github issues.

I sincerely thank [Ashvith Shetty](https://github.com/Ashvith) for modernizing the build system
for this software in 2022. Things are a lot easier to handle now than they were
in 2011!
