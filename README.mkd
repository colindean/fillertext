Introduction
------------

FillerText is a gem useful for generating, well, filler text. It can do the
standard "lorem ipsum" text or a variety of other clever substitute texts.

Installing FillerText
---------------------

Install using:

    gem install fillertext

or add the gem to your project's Gemfile:

    gem 'fillertext'

Using FillerText
----------------

Here's how you use FillerText. 

There are two main ways. One is cleaner because it keeps FillerText within its
own namespace. The other method will add Integer#filler to keep some tasty
syntactical sugar.

    FillerText::FillerText.sentences 5
    FillerText::FillerText.words 2
    FillerText::FillerText.characters 5
    FillerText::FillerText.bytes 4
    FillerText::FillerText.paragraphs 1

or the *much* easier and intended method:

    2.filler.sentences
    1.filler.paragraphs

You can also change the style from the default "lorem ipsum" to something else.

    FillerText::FillerText.style = FillerText::Style::LoremIpsum
    FillerText::FillerText.style = FillerText::Style::HipsterIpsum
    FillerText::FillerText.style = FillerText::Style::YinzerIpsum
